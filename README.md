# 👋 Hi, I’m David Ponce De Leon
## About Me
I am a student at **Westmont College** pursuing my Bachelors in **Computer Science** and I am interested in all things Python & Data Science!
When I am not busy with school projects, you will find me playing volleyball (beach and indoor) 🏐, swimming at the beach 🌊, and lifting weights 💪.

🌱 I’m currently working on an Estate Settlement Application to make the process a lot simpler and much more efficient.
